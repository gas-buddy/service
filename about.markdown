GasBuddy was [founded in 2000](https://www.gasbuddy.com/about/timeline) as a crowd sourced fuel pricing web site to help consumers save money on gas. We are now a part of [PDI Technologies](https://pditechnologies.com/) providing a wide array of software solutions to the retail industry including [sustainability solutions](https://pditechnologies.com/engage-customers/sustainability-solutions/).

When things happen that relate to fuel (pipeline crises, despots invading sovereign nations), GasBuddy experiences very high demand - sometimes 10x our average load. As such we've had to get better at scaling quickly and efficiently. We are not Google, but that may have its pluses and minuses for you and your potential use of our open source tools.
